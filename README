Overview
--------

	The REDCapAPI package provides classes that simplify the use
of the REDCap application programming interface (API).

        The REDCap API is a set of web services that allow other
programs to interoperate with REDCap by exporting or importing data
using HTTP Post requests. The REDCap development team supplies a
class, RestCallRequest, which wraps the lower level code needed to
encrypt, send, receive, and decrypt messages to the REDCap service in
easier-to-use methods.

	The REDCapAPI classes build on RestCallRequest to provide
higher level methods for commonly performed tasks such as exporting
sets of records defined by various criteria, importing records, and
reporting problems via email. The REDCapAPI classes also provide methods
for common related tasks such as checking advanced link authorization,
retrieving parameters sent by a data entry trigger, and checking
whether or not a request was sent by an authorized server.
